# System Disruption Analysis: Load Balancer Configuration Incident

## Issue Summary

On April 15, 2024, between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM (UTC-5), our API endpoint experienced a significant disruption, impacting approximately 30% of our users. The disruption manifested as login failures and noticeable delays in response times.

## Root Cause

Investigations revealed that the root cause of this disruption was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. Instead of evenly distributing incoming traffic among backend servers, the load balancer favored one server excessively, leading to performance degradation and service interruptions.

## Timeline

- 10:00 AM: Monitoring systems flagged an increase in error rates, signaling potential issues.
- 11:00 AM: Engineers shifted focus to the load balancer configuration after ruling out database-related issues.
- 12:00 PM: Misconfigurations were identified and escalated to the infrastructure team for resolution.
- 2:00 PM: Corrective actions were taken, restoring normal operation of the API endpoint.

## Root Cause Analysis and Resolution

The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings disrupted the equilibrium of traffic distribution, causing strain on specific backend servers and impeding user access. The issue was resolved by adjusting the load balancer settings to ensure fair and balanced traffic distribution across all backend servers.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar incidents in the future, we are implementing the following measures:
1. Enhanced load balancer monitoring to promptly detect and address configuration anomalies.
2. Implementation of automated load testing to validate load balancer performance and configurations.
3. Regular audits and reviews of load balancer settings to maintain optimal traffic distribution and system stability.
